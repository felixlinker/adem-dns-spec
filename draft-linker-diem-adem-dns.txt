1.  Introduction

   The ADEM Core Specification specifies how a set of _tokens_, encoded
   as JSON Web Signatures (JWSs) [RFC7515], can be used as a digital
   emblem to signal that digital assets enjoy specific protections under
   International Humanitarian Law (IHL).  This document describes a DNS-
   based distribution and discovery for ADEM tokens.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  DNS Distribution

   Given a set of tokens containing exactly one emblem and zero or more
   associated endorsements, issuers can distribute this set via DNS TXT
   records [RFC1035], as follows.

   For each such set, issuers MAY choose a unique _identifier_ string.
   If multiple sets of tokens are associated with a given domain name,
   issuers SHOULD choose such a string.

   Each token is distributed as its own TXT record, which includes a key
   and a value.  The value encodes the token in JWT compact
   serialization.  To prevent redundancy and keep tokens short, issuers
   MAY provide verification keys using TXT records as well instead of
   encoding them in the headers or bodies of tokens.  In that case, the
   value of the record MUST be the corresponding key in JWK format
   without any whitespaces.

   Each record's key MUST be formatted as:

   key := type [ "-" identifier ] | "adem-key"

   type := "adem-emb" | "adem-end"

   identifier := CHARACTER-NO-HYPEN+

   record := key "=" value

   CHARACTER-NO-HYPEN is any printable ASCII character as specified in
   [RFC0020] except for "-".  DIGIT is the range of ASCII characters "0"
   to "9". type MUST coincide with the token's "cty" claim.  If present,
   identifier MUST coincide with the string identifying the token's set.

4.  DNS Querying

   To effectively query a DNS record for emblems, verifiers need to
   distinguish different sets of tokens.  In this section, we detail how
   to extract all a domain name's associated sets of tokens.

   First, a verifier MUST resolve a domain name's TXT records.

   Second, for each record, starting with one of the values of type, the
   verifier parses the record according to the above.  Records for which
   parsing fails MUST be ignored.

   Third, for each emblem identified in the previous step, the verifier
   assembles a set of tokens and verification keys.  Any token which
   either has the same identifier as the emblem, or has no identifier
   MUST be considered as belonging to that emblem's set of tokens.  Any
   key included in TXT record MUST be considered for verification
   purposes.

   Finally, for each of these sets, the verifier can proceed to verify
   them as specified in.
